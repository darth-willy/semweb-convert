# semweb-convert
A web service to convert rules (SPARQL Construct format) and RDF data to a limited number of other formats.

In the file `www/js/webservice.js`, you can find examples on how to perform rule and data conversion.

Just run the web service (configure its URL in `www/js/config.js`) and open the `www/webservice.html` file in your favourite browser. Any errors returned by the service will be shown in the JS console.
